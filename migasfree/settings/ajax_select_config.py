AJAX_SELECT_BOOTSTRAP = False
# True: [easiest]
#   use the admin's jQuery if present else load from jquery's CDN
#   use jqueryUI if present else load from jquery's CDN
#   use jqueryUI theme if present else load one from jquery's CDN
# False/None/Not set: [default]
#   you should include jQuery, jqueryUI + theme in your template

AJAX_SELECT_INLINES = False
# 'inline': [easiest]
#   includes the js and css inline
#   this gets you up and running easily
#   but on large admin pages or with higher traffic it will be a bit wasteful.
# 'staticfiles':
#   @import the css/js from {{STATIC_URL}}/ajax_selects
#     using django's staticfiles app
#   requires staticfiles to be installed and to run its management command
#     to collect files
#   this still includes the css/js multiple times and is thus inefficient
#   but otherwise harmless
# False/None: [default]
#   does not inline anything. include the css/js files in your compressor stack
#   or include them in the head of the admin/base_site.html template
#   this is the most efficient but takes the longest to configure

# when using staticfiles you may implement your own ajax_select.css
# and customize to taste
