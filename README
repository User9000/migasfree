    * Clients:
        o

Features
========
    * Web administration
    * Multiuser
    * Multiversion (You can have desktops with differents versions and/or Distributions of GNU/Linux) 
    * Automated Data Capture (you do not worry about adding hostnames, users, context, ips, devices, etc. to migasfree)
    * Centralized system errors
    * Centralized system faults
    * Hardware inventory
    * Software inventory
    * System queries from the admin site
        

Behavior:
=========
How can you change the configuration of machines with migasfree?

When the user opens session in the machine, a bash script queries to server migasfree and it responds with other bash script created 'ad hoc' for this client after consulting the database.

This script is executed in the client and basically configure the repositories of packages (rpm or deb). Previously, these repositories have been created for the server when the migasfree's administrator configures a distribution.

A distribution in migasfree defines the packages that should will be installed, updated or removed in the clients in function of its HOSTNAME, USER, CONTEXT LDAP, VIDEO CARD, ... (the administrator defines the variables that he wants to use in his organitation) 

All changes of configuration in the client are made through packages. This is the main difference respected other systems management systems. Therefore it is necessary that you know how create packages in order you can realize the change of configuration in the machines that you want administrate. You can consider hiring a professional, this is the hard work, you were warned! 


Use:
====
For example: You want change the Firefox homepage in all PCs in range of IPs.

    1.- You must create a package (for example myorg-firefox-1-0.rpm or ) that realize this homepage change. You must investigate what file must modify and do that your package do it for you. This is hard!

    2.- You must upload your package to server. This is simple!

    3.- You must create a distribution in migasfree. Add your package myorg-firefox-1-0.rpm and define the range of IPs. This is easy!

    4.- Voil√†! When a user opens a session and his IP is in range, will be install the package and changed Firefox homepage.
