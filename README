Behaviour
=========

How can you change the software configuration of machines with migasfree?

When the user opens a session in the machine, a bash script queries the server migasfree and it responds with other bash scripts created 'ad hoc' for this client after consulting the database.

This script is executed in the client and basically configures the repositories of packages (rpm or deb). Previously, these repositories have been created for the server when the migasfree's administrator configures a repository.

A repository in migasfree defines the packages that should  be installed, updated or removed in the clients in function of attributes of client computer: HOSTNAME, USER, CONTEXT LDAP, VIDEO CARD, ... (the administrator defines the properties that he wants to use in his organisation)

All changes of configuration in the client are made through packages. Therefore it is necessary that you know how create packages in order to change the configuration of the machines that you want administrate. You can consider hiring a professional, this is the hard work, you were warned!


Use
===

For example: You want change the Firefox homepage in all PCs in a range of IPs.

    1.- You must create a package (for example myorg-firefox-1-0.rpm or myorg-firefox-1-0.deb). You must investigate which files need to be modified and allow the package to perform the task of changing the configuration. This is hard work!

    2.- You must upload your package to the server. This is simple!

    3.- You must create a repository in migasfree. Add your package myorg-firefox-1-0 and define the range of IPs. This is easy!

    4.- Voil√†! When a user opens a session and his IP is in range, migasfree install the package.
