==================================================

Welcome to migasfree!

First of all, thanks a lot to download this software. We hope that this software is useful for you.


Description:
============
Migasfree is a very simple, but effective, system management systems. Actually, it is used in 'Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza' (Spain) by initial authors in the project 'migration to open source software for desktops'. They use AZLinux distribution http://zaragozaciudad.net/azlinux , which is based on SUSE (http://www.novell.com/linux)

Authors:

See AUTHORS file 


Requirements
============
    * Server:
        o Apache with Mod_python
        o Django 
        o Sqlite3 (you can use others databases Django aproved)

    * Clients:
        o to define


Features
========
    * Web administration
    * Multiuser
    * Multiversion (You can have desktops with differents versions and/or Distributions of GNU/Linux) 
    * Automated Data Capture (you do not worry about adding hostnames, users, context, ips, devices, etc. to migasfree)
    * Centralized system errors
    * Centralized system faults
    * Hardware inventory
    * Software inventory
    * System queries from the admin site
        

Behavior:
=========
How can you change the software configuration of machines with migasfree?

When the user opens session in the machine, a bash script queries to server migasfree and it responds with other bash script created 'ad hoc' for this client after consulting the database.

This script is executed in the client and basically configure the repositories of packages (rpm or deb). Previously, these repositories have been created for the server when the migasfree's administrator configures a repository.

A repository in migasfree defines the packages that should will be installed, updated or removed in the clients in function of attributes of client computer: HOSTNAME, USER, CONTEXT LDAP, VIDEO CARD, ... (the administrator defines the properties that he wants to use in his organitation) 

All changes of configuration in the client are made through packages. Therefore it is necessary that you know how create packages in order you can realize the change of configuration in the machines that you want administrate. You can consider hiring a professional, this is the hard work, you were warned! 


Use:
====
For example: You want change the Firefox homepage in all PCs in a range of IPs.

    1.- You must create a package (for example myorg-firefox-1-0.rpm or myorg-firefox-1-0.deb ) that realize this homepage change. You must investigate what file must modify and do that your package do it for you. This is hard work!

    2.- You must upload your package to server. This is simple!

    3.- You must create a repository in migasfree. Add your package myorg-firefox-1-0 and define the range of IPs. This is easy!

    4.- Voil√†! When a user opens a session and his IP is in range, migasfree install the package.


Documentation:
==============

You can start reading the document 'Quick Start' available in the 'doc' directory of project or in http://migasfree.org

All documentation is also available in http://migasfree.org


Testing:
========

You can test migasfree downloading a appliance for VirtualBox with a migasfree server full installed. This appliance is available in the download area of http://migasfree.org


That's all folks
